Description: Implements multiple imputation of missing covariates by
    Substantive Model Compatible Fully Conditional Specification.
    This is a modification of the popular FCS/chained equations
    multiple imputation approach, and allows imputation of missing
    covariate values from models which are compatible with the user
    specified substantive model.
